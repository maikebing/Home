2018年七月11日， 我来到了北京 感谢开源社区网友的帮忙， 因此 我希望能为社区做更多奉献。 


March 2007 to July 2018：

I work in a company that provides software solutions for Xinjiang Highway Bureau..

我当时在一家专门为新疆公路部门提供软件解决方案的公司工作。

When I encounter any problems, I like open source solution, at the same time, I am keen to contribute to the open source community,So I want to list some of the projects I'm involved in, and when I'm old enough to write code, these will be my best memories.

当我遇到任何问题 都喜欢使用开源解决方案， 与此同时， 我也为开源社区添砖加瓦 因此我想把我参与的一些项目列在这里 ， 当我老到不能写代码的时候  这一切将是我最美好的回忆。
